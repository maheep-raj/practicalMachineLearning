## Introduction

This project is a part of Practical Machine Learning course of JHU Data Science specialization. The instruction statement reads as "One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, your goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants". The goal of the project is to predict the manner in which they did the exercise.
